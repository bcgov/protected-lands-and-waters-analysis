* Conserved lands and waters are legally established areas set aside to protect nature and cultural values. Conserved areas, particularly BC Parks, are well-used by British Columbians with 6 in 10 people visiting a provincial park each year^1^.
* **Conserved lands and water cover `r land_total`% of B.C.'s terrestrial areas and inland water and `r water_total`% of coastal and marine areas.** B.C.'s network of conserved lands and waters contribute to the [Convention on Biological Diversity Aichi Target 11](https://www.cbd.int/aichi-targets/target/11) commitments to set aside 17% of terrestrial areas and 10% of marine areas by 2023 (was previously 2020). 
* B.C.'s conserved areas include national and provincial parks and protected areas (PPAs) and other effective area-based conservation measures [(OECMs)](https://www.iucn.org/commissions/world-commission-protected-areas/our-work/oecms#:~:text=What%20is%20an%20'OECM'%3F,biodiversity%20outside%20of%20protected%20areas). 
* For terrestrial areas/inland water, the conserved areas are comprised of `r round(land_ppa$summary_total,1)`% PPAs and `r round(land_oecm$summary_total,1)`% OECMs.
* Marine areas in B.C. are comprised of `r round(water_ppa$summary_total, 1)`% PPAs and `r round(water_oecm$summary_total,1)`% OECMs.
* The amount of conserved lands and water is not evenly distributed across B.C. The following provides a glance at the distribution of conserved areas across B.C. and the representation of different ecosystems.

## Trends in the Conservation of British Columbia's Terrestrial and Marine Ecoregions

* B.C. is divided into [ecoregions](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/plants-animals-and-ecosystems/ecosystems/broad-ecosystem/an_introduction_to_the_ecoregions_of_british_columbia.pdf). Ecoregions are considered 'big picture' ecosystems and group nearby areas with similar climate and geologic features together. 
* There are 40 terrestrial, 4 marine, and 2 ecoregions with marine and terrestrial components across B.C. 
* The most conserved terrestrial ecoregions are located in the northwest corner of B.C. - St. Elias Mountains and Chugach Mountains and Icefields are both 99% protected. 
* The least conserved terrestrial ecoregions are the Pelly Mountains (1.2%) and the Peace River Basin (2.6%).
* The most conserved marine ecoregion is the Transitional Pacific (51.1%) and the least conserved is the marine component of the Georgia Puget Basin (4.6%).

## Terrestrial Ecosystem Representation within Conserved Lands in B.C.

* The distribution of conserved areas is also shown by [biogeoclimatic zones (BEC)](https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hre/becweb/). 
* BEC zones are defined by the terrestrial ecosystems that develop in an area due to the climate and geography. They provide insight into the soils and plant communities you would expect to see in an area. 
* Conserved lands are not evenly distributed among British Columbia's ecosystems. High elevation and mountainous areas such as the Boreal Altai Fescue Alpine and the Interior Mountain-heather Alpine zones are over 30% conserved while representing less than 7% of the province's ecosystems.
* By contrast, low elevation, warm zones such as Coastal Western Hemlock are more common across B.C. and tend to be less conserved (< 15% of BEC zone).

## Details of Conserved Land & Water Designations in B.C. - NOT UPDATED YET

-   **BC Parks (14.4% terrestrial; 0.9% marine)**

    -   Most of the protected land and a third of the protected waters
        in B.C. are managed by [BC
        Parks](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/).
    -   Protected areas managed by BC Parks are governed by several
        pieces of
        [legislation](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/aboutBCParks/legis.html)
        and fall into one of the following designations: Ecological
        Reserve, Provincial Park, Protected Area, Conservancy,
        Recreation Area.

-   **National Protected Areas (0.7% terrestrial; 2.2% marine)**

    -   The Government of Canada has established protected land and
        marine areas in British Columbia, for example National Parks,
        National Wildlife Areas, Marine Protected Areas and Migratory
        Bird Sanctuaries.
    -   These designations are governed by several pieces of federal
        legislation including: [*Canada National Parks Act*, *Canada
        National Marine Conservation Areas
        Act*](http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/agen/dp-pd/lr-ar/lr-ar1.aspx),
        [*Canada Wildlife Act*, *Migratory Birds Convention
        Act*](http://www.ec.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=E826924C-1), and
        the [*Oceans Act
        (1996)*](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/O-2.4/).

-   **B.C. Provincial Administered Conservation Lands (0.26%
    terrestrial; 0.07% marine)**

    -   [Administered Conservation
        Lands](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/fw/habitat/conservation-lands/)
        are lands over which the Government of British Columbia has
        legal administrative and management authority.
    -   Wildlife Management Areas are Administered Conservation Lands
        that are designated under the provincial [*Wildlife
        Act*](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/fw/wildlife/) to protect habitat
        for regionally, nationally or internationally significant
        species.
    -   Other types of Administered Conservation Lands are aquired by
        way of: [*Land
        Act*](http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/00_96245_01)
        section 106 Transfers of Administration, Fee Simple Acquisitions
        (through direct purchase, donation, or land exchange), and Lease
        Sites.

-   **B.C. Non-Government Organization Conservation Areas (0.1%
    terrestrial)**

    -   [B.C. Non-Government Organization Conservation
        Areas](http://ltabc.ca/resources/2012-02-05-22-20-02), also
        known as private conservation lands, include Fee Simple areas,
        defined as ownership of the title to a legal parcel, and
        Registerable Interests --- other conservation securements
        registered on title, such as conservation covenants and leases.


## Methods

* This indicator uses data from the [Canadian Protected and Conserved Areas Database](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/national-wildlife-areas/protected-conserved-areas-database.html). The [Old Growth Management Areas - Legal - Current](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/old-growth-management-areas-legal-current) and the [Wildlife Habitat Areas](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/wildlife-habitat-areas-approved) datasets from DataBC were also used to fill in missing dates. 
* Municipal and regional parks are not included in the analyses. Overlaps between protected areas have been accounted for in the analyses. 
* The [**R**](http://www.r-project.org) code for repeating the analyses presented on this page is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/bcgov/protected_areas_analysis).
